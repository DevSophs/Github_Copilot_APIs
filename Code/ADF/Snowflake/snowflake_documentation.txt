Azure Data Factory ETL Pipeline Documentation
Overview
This documentation covers the ETL pipeline implementation for loading data warehouse dimensions and facts into Snowflake using Azure Data Factory (ADF).

Architecture Components
1. Linked Services
Snowflake Connection: Manages connectivity to Snowflake database

{
    "name": "SnowflakeConnection",
    "type": "Snowflake",
    "connectionString": "<secure-connection-string>"
}

2. Datasets
Source Datasets (Staging)
STG_CUSTOMER
STG_ACCOUNT
STG_ACC_CUST
STG_CARDS
STG_TRANSACTIONS
Target Datasets (Snowflake)
DIM_CUSTOMER
DIM_ACCOUNT
DIM_CARDS
FACT_TRANSACTIONS

3. Data Flows
Each dimension/fact has its own data flow with specific transformations:

DIM_CUSTOMER Data Flow

{
    "name": "DimCustomerToSnowflake",
    "type": "MappingDataFlow",
    "transformations": [
        "Derived Columns (full name concatenation)",
        "SCD Type 2 fields generation",
        "Column mapping and selection"
    ]
}

Table Structures
Dimension Tables
DIM_CUSTOMER
Column	Type	Description
id_customer	NUMBER	Primary Key
te_full_name	VARCHAR(100)	Concatenated name
nu_age	NUMBER	Customer age
dt_start	DATE	SCD2 start date
dt_end	DATE	SCD2 end date
fl_active	NUMBER(1)	Active record flag
Implementation Steps
Prerequisites

Snowflake account and warehouse setup
Azure Data Factory instance
Required permissions and roles
Deployment Process
# Deploy using Azure PowerShell
Set-AzDataFactoryV2Pipeline -ResourceGroupName "YourRG" -DataFactoryName "YourADF" -Name "DWH_Loading_Pipeline_Snowflake" -DefinitionFile ".\pipeline\DWH_Loading_Pipeline.json"

Configuration

Update linked service connection strings
Set appropriate compute settings
Configure error handling
Monitoring and Maintenance
Pipeline Monitoring
Access ADF monitoring section
Check activity runs
Monitor data flow execution
Error Handling
Connection failures
Data type mismatches
Transformation errors
Performance Optimization
Adjust Snowflake warehouse size
Configure appropriate data flow compute settings
Implement partitioning strategies
Security Considerations
Credential Management

Use Azure Key Vault for sensitive information
Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
Data Protection

Enable encryption in transit
Implement column-level encryption if needed
Best Practices
Development

Use source control for pipeline definitions
Implement CI/CD pipelines
Follow naming conventions
Testing

Test with sample data first
Validate transformations
Check performance metrics
Production

Monitor pipeline execution
Set up alerts
Maintain documentation
Troubleshooting Guide
Common issues and solutions:

Connection timeouts
Memory limitations
Performance bottlenecks
